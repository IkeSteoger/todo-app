## Project: Context API

### Author: Ike Steoger

### Problem Domain

- In Phase 1, weâ€™re going to perform some refactoring of a Todo application built by another team. This application mixes application state and user settings at the top level and passes things around. It was a good proof of concept, but we need to make this production ready.
